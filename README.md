# FlappyTurd
After spending 3 years in high school studying programming, and then another 4 years in university studying software engineering... It is finally time to put my skills to good use.

Introducing Flappy Turd, a total new revolutionary game that is probably not a copy of Flappy Bird. Well, actually it might be a copy of Flappy Bird, but that all depends on how much effort I decide to put into this project. So yeah, fine, it's going to be Flappy Bird. But instead of a bird, we have a turd, which will be a bit more of an accurate representation of the game.

## Current Situation
Currently, I have coded up a rough prototype of the game using Python.
You can basically think of it as pseudocode for the Android version that will written in Java.

TO DO:
1) Fix up the cr*ppy code that doesn't seperate view components with controller components.
2) Fix the redundant comments.
3) Convert to an Android Studio Project.
