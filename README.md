# FlappyTurd
After spending 3 years in high school studying programming, and then another 4 years in university studying software engineering... It is finally time to put my skills to good use.

Introducing Flappy Turd, a total new revolutionary game that is probably not a copy of Flappy Bird. Well, actually it might be a copy of Flappy Bird, but that all depends on how much effort I decide to put into this project. So yeah, fine, it's going to be Flappy Bird. But instead of a bird, we have a turd, which will be a bit more of an accurate representation of the game.
